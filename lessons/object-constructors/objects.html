        But in the long run, you will create multiple data, just like example
        above which is not sustainable in the long run.
      </p>

      <h1 class="lesson-title my-3 mx-28 py-1 border-b text-left">Objects Constructors</h1>

      <p>
        The proper way to solve it is to reusing the properties of it which will
        be easier and sustainable.

      <p>Let's explain it line by line.</p>

      <p>
        As you can see in this line. We use the function to be a object which is
        called <strong><em>Object Constructor</em></strong
        >. It uses a reuseable object to avoid repeating declaration of same
        propety just like the first example.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can see that you can add a function inside the object constructor
        which is the <strong><em>this.info</em></strong> function.
      </p>

        You'll noticed that I am using <strong><em>this</em></strong> keyword
        which make them reusable. Because it serves a purpose that it reference
        to a certain object that is declared which will be shown in next
        example.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to call and use the object constructor, we must create a new
        variable and call the created object constructor by using "new" keyword
      </p>

      <p >
        The relation of <strong><em>this</em></strong> keyword to the created
        variable is to reference where it came from. It does not store into the 
        object constructor but it reference to the created variable which is
        <strong><em>reader1</em></strong>. It shows that <strong><em>reader1</em></strong> has containing the data which is:
        <ul class="text-left mx-32 font-medium list-disc list-inside text-[#fcfcfc] pb-12">
          <li><strong><em>Title: The Hobbit</em></strong></li>
          <li><strong><em>Author: J.R.R Tolkien</em></strong></li>
          <li><strong><em>Pages: 295</em></strong></li>
          <li><strong><em>Read: false</em></strong></li>
        </ul> 
      </p>

      <h1 class="lesson-title my-3 mx-28 py-1 border-b text-left">Prototype Inheritance</h1>

      <p>Since we have the idea to reuse the function without repetitive declaration of object. 
        There is a great way also that we can clone the object with declaring the same properties. 
        It is called <strong><em>Prototype Inheritance</em></strong>.</p>

        <p>There are three ways to implement the <strong><em>Prototype Inheritance</em></strong>:</p>
        <ol class="text-left mx-32 font-medium list-decimal list-inside !list-decimal text-[#fcfcfc]">
          <li>Using Object.setPrototypeOf</li>
          <li>Using Object.create "Constructor Method"</li>
          <li>Using ES6 Class (Modern JavaScript Implementation)</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="font-black text-3xl">1. Using Object.setPrototypeOf()</p>
        
        <p>It shows how to inherit the constructor by using Object.setPrototypeOf. 
        </p>

        <ol class="text-left mx-32 list-decimal list-inside !list-decimal text-[#fcfcfc]">
          <li>
            Parent Construtor is the Book function with the properties of
            title, author, pages, and read. Instead of including the function/method info() 
            inside the Parent Constructor, I separate it to make it readable and 
            doing the standard for creating function for inheritance.
          </li>
          <br>
            <li>
              Child Constructor is the SelfImprovementBook function. To inherit the class from Parent Constructor
              (Book Function), it must use ParentConstructor.call(this, ...) to inherit and initialize shared properties.
              Also to add a new properties, you must put after the ParentConstructor.call() method.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              In using Object.setPrototypeOf(param1,param2), it has two parameter.
              <br>
              Param1 = Child Constructor (SelfImprovementBook)
              <br>
              Param2 = Parent Constructor (Book) 
              <br>
              In this way, we inherit the properties from Parent to Child Constructor.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              I add function/method named showTopic to do some function. 
              In order to do that. I must call ChildConstructor.prototype.showTopic. 
              Just like in the previous way of creating methods for cleaner approach.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              In order to use the inherited prototype, I must create new instances which is 
              book1 and book2 and using <strong><em>new</em></strong> keyword to use created constructor.
            </li>

<p class="font-black text-3xl">2. Using Object.create() "Constructor Method"</p>

<p>It shows how to inherit the constructor by using Object.create(). 
  It is the same as Object.setPrototypeOf() but it differs usage scenarios.
</p>

<ol class="text-left mx-32 list-decimal list-inside !list-decimal text-[#fcfcfc]">
  <li>
    Parent Construtor is the Book function with the properties of
    title, author, pages, and read. Instead of including the function/method info() 
    inside the Parent Constructor, I separate it to make it readable and 
    doing the standard for creating function for inheritance.
  </li>
  <br>
    <li>
      Child Constructor is the SelfImprovementBook function. To inherit the class from Parent Constructor
      (Book Function), it must use ParentConstructor.call(this, ...) to inherit and initialize shared properties.
      Also to add a new properties, you must put after the ParentConstructor.call() method.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      In using Object.create(param1), it has one parameter.
      <br>
      Param1 = Parent Constructor (Book)
      <br>
      In order to use it. We have a pattern to use:
      <br>
      ChildConstructor.prototype = Object.create(ParentConstrutor.prototype);
      <br>
      In this way, we inherit the properties from Parent to Child Constructor.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      This will be different from Object.setprototypeof because we need to point our inherited constructor
      which is Child Constructor to itself to work properly. To do it, we must have a pattern that
      <br>
      ChildConstructor.prototype.constructor = ChildConstructor;
      <br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      I add function/method named showTopic to do some function. 
      In order to do that. I must call ChildConstructor.prototype.showTopic. 
      Just like in the previous way of creating methods for cleaner approach.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      In order to use the inherited prototype, I must create new instances which is 
      book1 and book2 and using <strong><em>new</em></strong> keyword to use created constructor.
    </li>
  </ol>

<p> Which One to Use?</p>
<ul class="text-left mx-32 font-medium list-disc list-inside text-[#fcfcfc] pb-12">
  <li>
    Object.create() is preferred when you want to set up inheritance from the start. 
    It creates a new prototype object, making it clearer and more efficient for 
    initial setups.
  </li>
  <li>
    Object.setPrototypeOf() is useful if you need to modify inheritance dynamically,
    such as when working with existing objects or prototypes that 
    were not initially linked correctly.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="font-black text-3xl">3. Using ES6 Class (Modern JavaScript Implementation)</p>

<p>
  It is different to the two examples above and this is the standard and modern way
  to inherit prototypes. 
</p>

<ol class="text-left mx-32 list-decimal list-inside !list-decimal text-[#fcfcfc]">
  <li>
    Parent Class is the Book function with the properties of
    title, author, pages, and read. I include the function/method info() 
    inside the Parent Class since this is the way to implement it.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Child Class was created and automatically insert word "extends"
    after the naming of child class and will be followed by parent class to
    inherit that properties and methods from parent class.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Inside the child constructor I use super() method instead of call() because
    this is the standard for the class inheritance. The implementation of super is same with call
    but without using "this" keyword. Just insert the properties from parent and same implementation when adding
    new properties from created child constructor. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    I created showTopic() method inside child class since it will be separated 
    function exclusive this child class only.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    In order to use the inherited prototype, I must create new instances which is 
    book1 and book2 and using <strong><em>new</em></strong> keyword to use created constructor.
  </li>

<p class="font-black text-2xl">Advantages of ES6 Classes</p>
<ul class="text-left mx-32 font-medium list-disc list-inside text-[#fcfcfc] pb-12">
  <li>
    Cleaner syntax: Classes provide a more readable and concise way to define inheritance.
  </li>
  <li>
    super() keyword: Simplifies calling the parent constructor and methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Encapsulation: Methods are defined directly within the class, keeping code organized.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prototypical inheritance under the hood: Even though classes offer syntactic sugar, they still follow JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance model.
  </li>

  <p>This modern approach is recommended for most new JavaScript projects, as it makes the code more intuitive and maintainable.</p>
